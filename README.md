## Aims for the day

From this we can discuss whether or not Vega-lite should be our go-to default in the coding standards and way we work.

Examples to aim for:

## Dataset options (or feel free to use your own open data ideas)

Dataset Option 1

Dataset Option 3


Dataset Option 4

Any other dataset, if you have an idea of an open dataset you’d like to work on then please do so. 

## Guidance

The aim of today's away day is to give you a chance to try out Vega-lite and the different ways of producing vega-lite visualisations. The way we suggests you do this is as follows:
1. Copy the code behind one of the Vega-lite examples into the Vega-lite editor code. Make some small changes to see whats possible.
2. ...

### Testing Vega-lite
Vega-lite has a simple interactive editor with a number of different examples to use as a base.

https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/tutorials/getting_started.html 

If you are lucky enough to be using an API or an open data source in JSON format then you’ll be able input this data directly into your vega-lite visualisations. If not you'll need to process the published csv files into 

### Altair & Processing open data

If you are lucky enough to be using an API or an open data source in JSON format then you’ll be able input this data directly into your vega-lite visualisations. However 

#### Python

Altair is a python module which abstracts vega-lite code
